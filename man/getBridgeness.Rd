\title{Calculate bridginess from consensus matrix}
\usage{
getBridgeness(gg, alg, conmat)
}
\arguments{
\item{gg}{igraph object}

\item{alg}{clustering algorithm}

\item{conmat}{consensus matrix calculated with that algorithm}
}
\value{
data.frame with first column contains vertex ID, if GeneName
attribute assigned to the vertices its value will be stored as a
second column, the last column contains bridginess values for the
}
\description{
Bridginess takes into account a vertices shared community membership
together with its local neighbourhood. It was proposed in
Nepusz et al., 2008 \url{doi:10.1103/PhysRevE.77.016107}.
}
\details{
Algorithm assume that clustering was already calculated and its
membership is stored in the appropriate vertex attribute. If
\link{\code{alg}} attribute is not found error will be issued.

conmat <- makeConsensusMatrix(gg, N=10,alg = 'louvain', type = 2, mask = 10)
