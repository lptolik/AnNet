\alias{escapeAnnotation}
\title{Escapes elements of list in annotation, so they'll be searchable by grep.}
\usage{
escapeAnnotation(annVec, col = COLLAPSE, esc = ESC)
}
\arguments{
\item{annVec}{vector of annotation strings}

\item{col}{term list separator character}

\item{esc}{escape character}
}
\value{
vector of annotation strings with elements escaped
}
\description{
In the case when annotation has not carefully planned, some annotation terms
could be substring of other, for example search fo DOID:14 could return
DOID:143, DOID:1433, and DOID:14330. To avoid this all terms should be
enclosed in escape characters, which unlikely to find within annotation
itself.
}
\details{
NOTE: spaces are treated as regular
characters, no trimming is applied before or after escaping.

\examples{
annVec<-apply(matrix(letters,ncol=13),2,paste,collapse=';')
