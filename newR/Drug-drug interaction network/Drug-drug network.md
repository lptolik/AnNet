# Drug-drug interaction network

## Dataset information

This is a network of interactions betweeen drugs, which are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Nodes represent drugs and edges represent drug interactions. Drug-drug interactions occur when the pharmacologic effect of a one drug is altered by the action of another drug, leading to unpredictable clinical effects such as adverse drug reactions. When several drugs are administered together, there might be a greater possibility of adverse drug reactions as one drug can increase or decrease the effect of another drug. It is thus crucial to identify drug-drug interactions, especially during drug development, when one needs to identify interactions between a new candidate drug and drugs that are already on the market.
