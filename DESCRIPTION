Description: the R package AnNet, developed to step by step analysis of PP 
            network with aim to quantify and rank each proteinâ€™s simultaneous 
            impact into multiple complexes based on network topology and 
            clustering. Package also enables estimating of co-occurrence of 
            diseases across the network and specific clusters pointing towards 
            shared/common mechanisms.
